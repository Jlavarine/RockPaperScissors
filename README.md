# **ü™®üìÑ‚úÑRock, Paper, Scissorsü™®üìÑ‚úÑ**

This web app allows users to play rock,paper,scissors with a computer player. The user has a choice of either Classic Mode or Difficult Mode(which gives the user 5 options to choose from instead of the normal 3). Rock, Paper, Scissors was a learning assignment for the Front End Development program at Turing School of Software and Design. The following contributors had approximately 5 weeks experience using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

# **Code Architecture**

This project consists of 5 primary files - Game.js, Player.js, Main.js, index.html, styles.css and ancillary files containing images.

- Game.js and Player.js are the two class files that interact with the data model.
- Main.js houses our JavaScript functionality

# **WAVE(Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)**

![Wave Summary](WAVE-Summary.png)
-Based on WAVE, this application fully implements HTML that is accessible for individuals with visual disabilities.
-This tool helped me practice my developer empathy skill!

# **Wins**

- I was able to create this web application using only one global variable in my main.js file.
- This application has the most moving parts on any project I have previously completed.

# **Future Updates**

- In the future I would like to add the option for local storage, so that if the user wanted to store their wins they could.
- As of right now, the win counter will reset on page load.
